## 📄 **Project Requirements: “Vibed to Cracked”**

---

## 🌱 **Vision & Audience**

Build a modern, creator‑driven, mobile‑friendly learning platform focused on JavaScript at launch, later HTML & CSS.
Target: “vibe coders” → beginners / hobbyists who value both _technical learning_ & _mood‑driven_, creator‑branded content.
Core idea: combine quizzes, coding practice, and short video explanations.

A user setting affecting:

- Visuals: theme color, background, maybe lo‑fi music embed.
- Difficulty: “Chill” → easier quizzes, less strict; “Grind” → harder quizzes, timed.
- Quiz frequency: “Rush” → more quizzes in same tutorial.
- Can store choice in user profile, fallback to cookie for guests.
